Hello! I'm a proficient Data Engineer with extensive expertise in Azure and ETL processes. With a solid background in designing and optimizing ETL processes, I leverage Azure Databricks for advanced data transformation and Azure Data Factory to orchestrate data pipelines seamlessly. My experience includes managing CI/CD processes through DevOps and Git, ensuring seamless integration and deployment of data solutions. I specialize in creating scalable, secure, and efficient data architectures that meet the dynamic needs of businesses.

But here's the catch: beyond my experience lies a curiosity-driven expertise that extends to the realms of machine learning and AI. I've spearheaded research and projects specializing in computer vision and robotics. Though they're not part of my current gig, I'm itching to blend them into my journey. My diverse background enables me to approach problems from unique perspectives, driving innovation and value.

Eager to connect and explore roles that leverage my data engineering expertise while incorporating my interests in machine learning and AI. Let's collaborate and drive success through cutting-edge technology and data-driven solutions.
